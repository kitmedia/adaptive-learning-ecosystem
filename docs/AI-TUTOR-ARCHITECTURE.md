## üî¨ Machine Learning Models

### Performance Prediction Model
```python
# RandomForestRegressor for student performance prediction
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=50, random_state=42)
features = [completion_rate, time_efficiency, engagement_score, help_requests]
target = future_performance_score
```

### Learning Style Classification
```python
# Multi-factor learning style detection
style_scores = {
    'visual': visual_preference_score,
    'auditory': auditory_preference_score, 
    'kinesthetic': kinesthetic_preference_score,
    'reading_writing': text_preference_score
}
dominant_style = max(style_scores, key=style_scores.get)
```

### Risk Assessment Algorithm
```python
# Dropout risk calculation
risk_factors = [performance_decline, low_engagement, pace_mismatch, help_frequency]
risk_score = weighted_sum(risk_factors)
risk_level = classify_risk(risk_score)  # low/medium/high/critical
```

## üìä Data Models

### Student Learning Profile
```python
class StudentLearningProfile:
    learning_style: LearningStyle
    learning_style_confidence: float
    preferred_pace: LearningPace
    current_difficulty_level: DifficultyLevel
    attention_span_minutes: int
    strengths: List[str]
    weaknesses: List[str]
    motivation_factors: List[str]
```

### Learning Activity Tracking
```python
class LearningActivity:
    completion_percentage: float
    time_spent_seconds: int
    correct_answers: int
    total_attempts: int
    help_requests: int
    engagement_score: float
```
